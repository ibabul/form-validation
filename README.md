 ### **Form Validation with JavaScript :**
 Sometimes we need to put a contact us form or any kind of form to interatct with customer so that we can gather some specific information about customer to provide them further information. So, we create some input section such as like :

 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Email
 - Phone Number.
etc

Within these input section there are some specifin input method for example - Name section is only for letters where customer input their name , email section is only for emails where customer input their mail address not their phone number or name.  
To make sure customer fill them in correct method there is a validation way you can create , by doing that customer will get alert about their wrong input.  
There is a default way of HTML to make this validation.But JavaScript makes it even more interective to look at. Here is our form page :

<img src='./images/ss1.png' height='240px' width='440px' >  

        Form page

This is our form with a Submit button. When we click on submit button our form will get tested for validation to make sure user input all the required element.
